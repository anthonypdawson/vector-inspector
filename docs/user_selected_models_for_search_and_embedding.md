 **Pluggable embedding provider** architecture, where the user can provide a model name or path, and vector-inspector handles everything else:

- detect the model  
- load it if local  
- fetch metadata (dimensions, modality, normalization rules)  
- validate compatibility with the target DB  
- run inference  
- normalize the output  
- cache the result  

This is the sweet spot between “full control” and “full convenience.”

**Breakdown**

---

# 🧩 1. Let the user specify *just* the model  
Something like:

- `"mxbai-embed-large"`  
- `"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`  
- `"nomic-embed-text"`  
- `"openai/text-embedding-3-large"`  
- `"clip-ViT-B-32"`  
- `"/home/user/models/custom-embedder"`  

vector-inspector then:

1. Checks if it’s a known model  
2. Checks if it’s installed locally  
3. If not installed, checks if it’s downloadable  
4. Loads it with the right pipeline  
5. Extracts metadata (dimensions, modality, dtype)  
6. Stores it as a reusable embedding provider  

This keeps the UX simple while giving power users full control.

# 🔍 2. You can reliably detect model metadata  
Most modern embedding models expose:

- `model.config.hidden_size`  
- `model.config.projection_dim`  
- `model.config.text_config.hidden_size`  
- `model.config.vision_config.hidden_size`  
- `model.config.embed_dim`  
- `model.config.output_dim`  

And for multimodal models (CLIP, SigLIP, Florence):

- text and image dimensions are identical  
- modality is detectable from the processor  
- preprocessing rules are standardized  

So you can automatically determine:

- vector dimensionality  
- supported modalities  
- normalization requirements  
- expected input types  

This is exactly the kind of intelligence vector-inspector is already good at.

# 🧠 3. This solves multimodal pain cleanly  
Right now we are struggling because:

- text models are easy  
- image models require different preprocessing  
- file models require chunking or multimodal pipelines  
- dimensionality mismatches break search  
- users don’t know which model was used originally  

Letting the user specify the model gives vector-inspector:

- correct dimensionality  
- correct preprocessing  
- correct modality routing  
- correct normalization  
- correct distance metric expectations  

Without having to hard‑code anything.

---

# 🔥 4. This also unlocks a killer feature: **model provenance**  
Once we know the model, we can store:

- model name  
- model version  
- dimensionality  
- modality  
- normalization rules  
- device used  
- timestamp  

This makes vector-inspector the first vector DB viewer that actually understands *where embeddings came from*.

That’s huge for debugging and migrations.

---

# 🚀 5. The UX can be incredibly simple  
Imagine a dropdown:

**Embedding Model**  
- Auto‑detect  
- Built‑in (Text)  
- Built‑in (Image)  
- Built‑in (Multimodal)  
- Custom (enter model name or path)

If the user chooses custom:

**Model name or path:**  
`sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`

Your tool:

- loads it  
- extracts metadata  
- shows “Embedding dimension: 768”  
- shows “Modality: text”  
- caches it  
- uses it for search  

That’s it.

---

# 🎯 6. This is the right direction for your tool  
It fits your philosophy perfectly:

- power when you want it  
- simplicity when you don’t  
- multimodal support without chaos  
- no need to write custom code  
- no need to host your own embedding API  
- no need to guess dimensionality  

It also positions your tool as the **developer workstation** for vector data — not just a viewer.
